# Knowledge-Representation-
Tasks Performed: 
Knowledge Representation via RDF (Resource Description Framework)
1. Create an RDF dataset* for the semantic net given in the figure (given in the repository)
1. The description should be split into two files as shown in the figure.
(a) Use standard suffix (.n3) for RDF/N3 files.
(b) Place the files on your Google Drive and note the IRLs.
(c) Have appropriate linkage between the files.
2. Use standard definitions for the classes and properties as far as possible, rather than local
definitions. You can extend standard definitions to create your own classes and
properties. Consult
(a) Dublin Core Metadata: https://dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/
(b) Schema.org: https://schema.org/
2. Write SPARQL queries* to retrieve.
1. Name of the author of the book titled “Cognitive Vision”, and the name of the institute
to which he is affiliated to
2. Title of the books written by authors affiliated to an institute with name “IIT-Jodhpur”
(Of course, you will get one result with the given data)
3. Use Virtuoso generic SPARQL endpoint http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql to run the
queries
